    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Philippines frequently faces typhoons that severely impact communities.
      During such disasters, poor coordination between residents, local governments, and NGOs often leads to duplicated relief efforts and delays in resource distribution.
      Our system provides a coordinated technology platform to improve speed and efficiency in disaster response.

    <h2>Conceptual Framework</h2>
    <p>
      The system connects communities, local governments, and NGOs in one platform.
      Residents can report damages and urgent needs, LGUs can update affected areas, and NGOs can manage available resources.
      These inputs are processed in a centralized database, displayed through a real-time disaster map for faster coordination and better decision-making.
